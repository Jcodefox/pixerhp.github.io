			I don't really have much to put here yet, so it's just a placeholder for now. (I am learning some html on the spot to do this though, which is cool. There's no CSS currently so the padding is a constant pixel value, so I apologize if it makes things look look awful on some viewport sizes, such as small windows or on mobile.) <br>

			You can find most of my various accounts and important places on my carrd: <a href="https://pixerhp.carrd.co/">(Link to my carrd)</a> <br>
			(In the situation that that somehow becomes a dead link, I'm currently trying to have all of my account usernames everywhere be "pixerhp", so you should be able to generally find me online somehow by searching for that.) <br>
